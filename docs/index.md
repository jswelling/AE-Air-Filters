# Overview

The goal here is to minimize the risk of COVID transmission at indoor
events in AEthelmearc, while hopefully allowing as many people as
possible to attend the events without masks.  Inexpensive air filter
boxes are believed to reduce transmission risk.

## Making Filters

Full instructions for building these air filter boxes can be found at
[DIY box fan filters - Corsi-Rosenthal box](https://cleanaircrew.org/box-fan-filters/).
We are doing our planning based on single-fan, single-filter versions
of the Corsi-Rosenthal box like [this](images/one_filter_one_fan.jpg).
We chose this design because it seems to be most efficient in terms of clean air per dollar,
and because it doesn't have to be broken down for transportation between sites.
Try to use a 2-inch-thick MERV-13 or MERV-14 filter with this design for best results.
One filter box of this type can provide approximately 5 air changes per minute for a 20'x20'
room with 8' ceilings.

If you have already made filter boxes with a different design,
_you don't have to change them!_ A filter box in the 'classic'
Corsi-Rosenthal design made with one fan and 4 filters apparently puts
out only about 25% more air than the single filter version.  That
means you can use fewer of them to get the needed air filtration for
your site, but it probably won't save you money.

## Transporting Filters

The filters should be good for several months of operation, long enough to serve at many
events and practices.  Handling the used filters is safe as long as you don't lick them.
We've learned that COVID is not generally spread by contact with surfaces, and that applies
to the filter boxes.  The easiest way to transport the single-filter units is just to put
them in a 30 gallon trash bag and put it in your car.  For planning purposes, one of those
units is about 20"x21"x7".
